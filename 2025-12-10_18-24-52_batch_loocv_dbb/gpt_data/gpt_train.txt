Most of us are raised with some version of the idea that being good pays off. Teachers say kindness will be rewarded. Parents say honesty keeps your conscience light and your life on track. Religions promise moral accounting. Even pop psychology slogans claim that “what goes around comes around.” Yet real life rarely feels so tidy. Good people get hurt. Selfish people get promoted. Empathy sometimes feels like an open wound rather than a strength. So the question demands a serious answer: Is it actually in your own best interests to be a good person? Does kindness, fairness, honesty, altruism lead to a better life?

To answer that, we need to go beyond comforting cliches and look at what research in neuroscience and performance psychology can tell us. These fields allow us to study how moral behavior influences stress, health, motivation, and the quality of our relationships. When taken together, the findings point to a surprisingly straightforward conclusion: being good is not only ethical, it is adaptive. A prosocial, trustworthy, compassionate lifestyle systematically improves mental health, enhances performance, strengthens relationships, and protects the body from stress-related harm. Goodness is not just about helping others. It changes the conditions of your own life.

Before deciding whether goodness “pays off,” we need to define what a “better life” means in scientific terms. Performance psychology defines optimal functioning as sustained growth, resilience, fulfillment, and success that align with personal values. Neuroscience adds biological elements: manageable stress, healthy emotional regulation, and strong social connection. Under those definitions, a good life is not simply pleasure or wealth or status. It is a life in which a person thrives psychologically, performs well in their pursuits, and remains physically healthy.

The human brain is built for social life. Our survival never depended on physical strength but on cooperation, fairness, and alliance formation. Evolution shaped neural systems for empathy, trust, and moral evaluation. Helping others activates reward pathways and releases dopamine and endorphins. Empathy and positive social contact promote oxytocin, which increases bonding and reduces stress. The very structure of our emotional and motivational networks suggests that goodness is a strategy that helped early humans survive and continues to serve us now.

Trust is one of the most valuable assets a person can possess. In performance psychology, trust accelerates collaboration, learning, and success. Good people generate trust. They attract cooperation. They become leaders others follow willingly. This gives them access to social resources that selfish individuals do not reliably possess. A reputation for integrity becomes a long-term competitive edge. Even though individualistic shortcuts can sometimes produce quick results, they rarely generate durable success.

Being a good person also strengthens meaning, which is one of the strongest predictors of long-term well-being. Moral behavior gives people a sense of purpose and coherence about who they are and why they matter. Neuroscience shows that purpose activates brain regions that support motivation, emotion regulation, and resilience. Meaning protects mental health when life becomes difficult. People who live according to ethical values tend to experience less depression, lower anxiety, and a deeper sense of fulfillment.

In contrast, immoral behavior may create immediate advantages but carries a psychological toll. Lying, cheating, manipulating, and exploiting others force the brain to maintain internal conflict and external vigilance. People who behave unethically often experience ongoing fear of exposure, guilt, and anxiety about judgment. These states elevate stress hormones, weaken the immune system, impair sleep, and increase the risk of physical illness. The body keeps track of moral conflict. Over time, unethical behavior acts like a corrosive substance on mental and physical health.

Integrity creates confidence. When people behave consistently with their values, they develop internal trust in themselves. This strengthens self-esteem and reduces decision fatigue because many choices become clear in advance. A strong moral identity creates stability under pressure, which improves performance across academics, athletics, and work. Character is a performance enhancer.

Kindness also acts as a force multiplier in groups. Leaders who are fair, empathetic, and supportive create environments in which people are more motivated, more creative, and more loyal. Goodness spreads. A healthy social environment boosts everyone’s ability to perform. Selfishness and cruelty, by contrast, erode trust and create cultures of fear, which ultimately limit growth and potential.

A fair objection arises: good people sometimes get exploited while selfish individuals sometimes succeed. That is undeniably true. But those successes are usually fragile. Exploitation destroys long-term support networks and often leads to loneliness, stress, and psychological breakdown. Even when selfishness generates material success, it rarely produces a life defined by love, peace, or meaning. A person may win in the short term by harming others, but they often lose in the long term by damaging their own sense of self and their relationships.

Vulnerability is built into goodness. Caring for others and acting with honesty gives people the ability to hurt you. Yet vulnerability is also the gateway to connection, and connection protects well-being. Social isolation pushes the brain into survival mode, increasing stress and impairing health. A life built on goodness may contain risk, but it also creates the relationships that make a human life worth living.

Another advantage of goodness is that it prevents avoidable suffering. When we treat others well, we avoid the conflicts, feuds, and crises that result from dishonesty or harm. Many of life’s worst problems come from broken relationships and damaged reputations. Goodness lowers the probability of those kinds of self-inflicted disasters.

Being good does not eliminate suffering, but it does change how we experience it. A person who has lived ethically can face difficulty without the added weight of guilt or shame. They are more likely to receive support from others. Neuroscience shows that social support can literally reshape how the brain processes pain and fear. Purpose also helps people interpret hardship as meaningful rather than senseless. Goodness does not shield us from pain, but it makes it less destructive.

It is also important to understand that being good is not a static trait. It is a set of habits that can be trained. Neuroscience shows that empathy, compassion, gratitude, and fairness become stronger with practice. Acting with integrity reinforces a moral self-image, which in turn makes future good behavior easier. The more goodness one expresses, the more natural it becomes.

The advantages of goodness accumulate through compounding. Each act of kindness strengthens relationships, supports health, deepens meaning, and reinforces a coherent identity. Each act of selfishness, manipulation, or cruelty breeds stress, mistrust, and insecurity. Over years, these differences create dramatically different life outcomes.

When we look at the whole picture — mental health, physical health, motivation, achievement, purpose, resilience, and the quality of relationships — the conclusion becomes clear. Being a good person is one of the most effective long-term strategies for creating a fulfilling and sustainable life. Goodness adapts to our biological wiring, improves how we think and perform, and gives us the best chance at happiness that endures beyond momentary pleasure.

This does not mean that every moral choice is rewarded immediately or visibly. Life is unpredictable, and bad things happen to good people. But on average, across the full arc of a life, goodness yields better outcomes than selfishness or cruelty. It makes a person stronger, healthier, more connected, and more at peace with themselves.

So yes: in a very real, deeply grounded psychological and biological sense, it is in your best interests to be a good person. Goodness is not naïve. It is a wise investment in your future self. It builds a life that remains meaningful even in hardship, a life surrounded by people who care, a life that you can look back on without regret.

Goodness does not guarantee a perfect life. Nothing does. But it gives you the greatest chance at a life worth living.
Racial capitalism begins with a simple but unsettling idea: inequality is not a flaw in capitalist systems, but one of their engines. The creation of wealth for some requires the exploitation of others, and throughout history those “others” have been defined along racial lines. Race became a tool for sorting human beings into categories of economic value — who would profit, who would labor, who would be controlled, who would be discarded. The consequences of this arrangement have shaped centuries of social reality, and they continue to define everyday life in ways that are easy to overlook because they have been so thoroughly normalized. When you examine the history closely, capitalism’s growth is inseparable from the commodification of racialized groups. And the institutions that claim to study human behavior and society — history, science, psychology — have often worked to reinforce rather than challenge these structures.

To understand racial capitalism, we have to begin with power. Capitalism concentrates power in the hands of those who own and control resources. In a fair system, economic mobility would allow anyone to rise through effort and innovation. But history shows that the playing field was uneven long before the game began. Slavery, colonial extraction, segregation, discriminatory policy, and policing did more than limit opportunity — they generated enormous wealth for those at the top while structurally withholding it from those at the bottom.

One of the most striking examples comes from the history of American law enforcement and incarceration. After the end of slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment famously prohibited forced labor — except as punishment for a crime. That loophole was not an oversight. It created a direct pathway for slavery to continue in a new form. Black Americans, newly freed from plantation labor, were arrested on vague charges like vagrancy or “suspicious behavior,” then leased out to corporations and industries that needed cheap labor. Incarceration became profitable, and Black bodies once again became instruments of economic expansion. The racial hierarchy had not disappeared; it had simply adapted to the legal system of a capitalist democracy.

The pattern repeated itself years later under the banner of “law and order.” Harsh drug policies punished heavily in the communities least protected from poverty and systemic neglect. Crack cocaine — associated with Black neighborhoods — carried sentences far more severe than powder cocaine — linked to wealthier, whiter users. The justification, framed as science and public safety, masked an economic logic: prisons filled, private contracts expanded, police departments gained funding, municipalities collected fines. Inequality was not incidental; it was profitable.

These mechanisms are not confined to the most dramatic examples of imprisonment or legislation. Sometimes they appear in the small details of daily life. In cities like Ferguson, Missouri, minor infractions — jaywalking, a broken tail light, missing paperwork — became opportunities for local governments to extract money from residents, who were disproportionately Black and poor. A single unpaid ticket could snowball into hundreds of dollars in fees, arrest warrants, and job-threatening legal troubles. When people cannot pay, they are punished; when they are punished, they are charged even more. Poverty becomes a revenue stream. Racial capitalism turns the struggle for survival into someone else’s gain.

The same logic extends into healthcare, housing, schooling — every domain where resources are distributed unevenly and those with the fewest resources have the highest costs. In medical settings, whose pain is believed? Whose symptoms are dismissed? Studies repeatedly show that Black patients receive poorer treatment than white patients, both due to bias and because the financial incentives of the U.S. healthcare system prioritize those who can pay more. Housing policy historically pushed Black families into underfunded neighborhoods with limited opportunity and higher exposure to environmental hazards, while property values — and therefore wealth accumulation — flourished in white suburbs protected by racist zoning laws. Even the most celebrated pillar of equality, education, has a hidden function: sorting students into economic roles that support the existing hierarchy.

This is where psychology enters the conversation. Psychology should be a science dedicated to understanding and helping humans. But for much of its history, it has served the interests of those who held power. Scientific racism dressed prejudice in the language of intelligence testing, biology, and mental health. It claimed that unequal outcomes reflected inherent differences rather than structural oppression. Psychological “expertise” was used to justify segregation, forced assimilation, and discrimination under the guise of objectivity. Instead of asking how society harms marginalized groups, psychology often asked what was wrong with those groups for struggling within harmful systems.

The result was a narrative that blamed the oppressed for the hardships imposed on them. Generations of people were told that their suffering was the outcome of personal deficits, not historical violence. The wealthy and powerful remained unquestioned. The oppressed were studied as problems rather than partners.

Yet not all scholarship accepted this arrangement. Movements like History from Below and Liberation Psychology emerged to confront the ways knowledge can either reinforce or challenge power. History from Below shifts focus away from kings, nations, and powerful leaders toward the everyday people whose labor, resistance, and survival actually shape history. It recognizes that the struggles of workers, enslaved people, and marginalized communities are not side notes — they are the foundation on which nations are built. When you tell the story from their perspective, the image of progress looks very different. The wealth of modern capitalism does not appear as the reward of innovation alone, but as the accumulated profit of extraction and exclusion.

Liberation Psychology takes a similar turn in a different field. Instead of treating individuals as isolated minds with internal disorders, it examines how social structures harm mental wellbeing. It recognizes that trauma, stress, and psychological suffering often stem from inequality — and that healing involves changing those systems, not forcing individuals to adapt to them. Where traditional psychology asked how to help marginalized people function within oppressive realities, liberation psychology asks how to dismantle the oppression itself.

These approaches flip the script. They say that the perspective of the oppressed is not an alternative version of the story; it is the truth that the dominant narrative worked to bury.

Understanding racial capitalism is not only about history. It’s about recognizing how current systems continue to operate on the same principles. Today, corporations profit from underpaid labor in gig economies where workers lack rights and stability. Neighborhoods historically segregated still display predictable disparities in wealth and opportunity. Political campaigns rely on racial fear to win votes that protect elite financial interests. Mental health disorders rise in communities living under constant stress, and the burden is placed on individuals to cope while the structural causes remain intact.

We also need to understand that racism adapts. It rarely announces itself openly. It appears through economic policies, scientific claims, and cultural norms that feel “neutral” but produce racially unequal outcomes. That is what makes racial capitalism so persistent. It hides its exploitation behind the appearance of fairness. It convinces society that success is simply a matter of effort, even when the ground is tilted so steeply that climbing is nearly impossible for some and effortless for others.

The challenge ahead is not simply documenting inequality — we have centuries of documentation already. The challenge is deciding what to do with that knowledge. Psychology has an opportunity here to shift fully away from its past role as a tool of justification and toward a future focused on empowerment. Researchers are now studying how inequality affects cognitive development, mental health, stress responses, and identity. They are identifying the pathways by which oppressive conditions produce harm. This knowledge can become a tool for change if we let it.

There are signs of progress. Community-based mental health programs challenge the idea that help must come from experts outside the community. Social psychology experiments reveal how stereotypes are learned, how biases form, and how systems can be redesigned to reduce their impact. Liberation psychology emphasizes collective action over individual coping, helping people recognize that their struggles are not evidence of personal failure but symptoms of unjust systems. History from Below encourages students — the future leaders and voters and policymakers — to see that the world they accept today was created by human decisions, and human decisions can change it.

Still, awareness is only the first step. Racial capitalism is deeply rooted, fueled by laws, profit structures, media narratives, and even the subconscious assumptions we inherit from the world around us. There is no single policy that will undo its effects, no brief period of reform that will erase centuries of exploitation. But shifting the lens — choosing to center the voices and experiences of those harmed by these systems — is a necessary beginning. If society continues to learn history only from the perspective of conquerors and capitalism only from the perspective of beneficiaries, the injustice will stay invisible.

The question, ultimately, is what kind of world we want to build. A system that requires some people to remain vulnerable for others to feel secure is not sustainable. A form of prosperity that depends on the suffering of others cannot be considered progress. If we believe that human beings deserve dignity, opportunity, and autonomy, then we need an economic system that reflects those values. That requires re-examining the foundations rather than patching up the visible cracks.

Racial capitalism teaches us that inequality is not an accident — it is a design. Liberation psychology and History from Below teach us that designs can be changed if the people they harm gain the ability to redefine the narrative. Psychology’s role must be to support that process, not obstruct it. History’s purpose must be to uncover the truth rather than protect the comfortable.

There is still a long way to go. But naming the connection between capitalism and racial exploitation gives us the language needed to challenge it. Listening to the stories of those who lived that exploitation gives us the motive to stop it. And recognizing that systems are human creations gives us the responsibility to build something better.

If racial capitalism created the world we inherited, then our task now is to ensure it does not define the world we leave behind.
Long before European ships appeared off the Cape, work, power, and survival in southern Africa were already tightly bound together. Communities organized themselves around scarce water, pasture, and grazing routes. A Kgosi’s authority rested not only on lineage or charisma, but on the ability to call on the ancestors and bring rain, pula. Cattle functioned as currency, kinship glue, and spiritual anchor all at once—“modimo o nko e metsi,” the god with the wet nose. Control over herds, grazing lands, and people’s labor underpinned status and authority. In other words, the foundations of political power were economic, and the foundations of the economy were labor.

At roughly the same time, far away, European empires were knitting the world together through trade routes, extraction, and conquest. The Dutch East India Company did not sail to the Cape in 1652 because it was curious about African societies; it came because ships needed to be fed, watered, and repaired on their way to Asia. When that commercial outpost at Table Bay collided with indigenous societies whose wealth was measured in cattle and people’s work, it set off a chain of transformations that would make labor the central axis of South African history.

From the slave lodge in early Cape Town to the diamond pits of Kimberley and the deep-level gold mines of the Witwatersrand, from the Glen Grey Act’s calculated “creation” of rural laborers to the Durban strikes of the 1970s and the mass unemployment and AIDS crisis in places like Mandeni at the end of apartheid, labor was never just an economic variable. It was the main lever through which land was taken, racial categories hardened, families reshaped, and resistance organized. To understand the making of South Africa, you have to follow the work: who did it, under what conditions, for whose benefit, and with what consequences.

This essay traces that story across several key moments and sites. It begins with slavery and coerced labor in the early Cape Colony, moves through the mineral revolution and the emergence of a migrant labor system, examines rural reengineering under the Glen Grey Act, looks at the explosion of worker resistance in Durban in 1973, and ends with the social wreckage of mass unemployment and disease around Mandeni in the late twentieth century. Across this arc, the argument is simple but far-reaching: South Africa’s political and social order was built, maintained, and ultimately destabilized through struggles over labor.

Early Cape Colony: Slavery, coerced work, and the making of a colonial labor force

When the Dutch East India Company established its refreshment station at the Cape, it had a straightforward problem: how to get food, fuel, and services at minimal cost from a place where European labor was scarce and expensive. The solution—predictable in the seventeenth-century Atlantic world—was slavery.

The Slave Lodge in Cape Town became the beating heart of this system. It was more than just a building; it was an experiment in compressing human diversity into a controllable labor force. Enslaved people were imported from East Africa, Madagascar, India, Southeast Asia, and other VOC possessions. Inside the lodge, these captives cooked, cleaned, built, tended gardens, and serviced the needs of officials. Outside, enslaved labor spread onto settler farms, workshops, and urban households.

Labor’s importance here appears in at least three ways.

First, slavery solved an economic bottleneck. The colony’s viability depended on a cheap and dependable workforce to produce grain, meat, wine, and other provisioning goods. Enslaved people’s bodies were turned into infrastructure: they terraced hillsides for vineyards, dug canals, built roads, and maintained the very outpost that anchored Dutch trade routes.

Second, the slave system reordered society and identity. With time, the enslaved population outnumbered free Europeans in the colony. Relationships—violent, coerced, but also intimate and everyday—between enslaved people, Khoisan, and European settlers produced new languages (Afrikaans emerging partly as a contact language), cuisines, and communities. Racial categories hardened in law in order to fix who could own labor and who could be owned. Slavery racialized labor, and labor solidified race.

Third, the practice of coercing labor at the Cape did not stop at the boundaries of formal slavery. As settler agriculture expanded inland, trekboers increasingly captured, indebted, and coerced Khoisan people into servitude. Even when not legally enslaved, many Khoisan workers were trapped by systems of debt, pass requirements, and violence that functioned in practice like unfree labor. Labor control was the underlying problem the colonial state and settler society repeatedly tried to “solve,” and each solution left deeper marks on South African society.

When Britain took permanent control of the Cape in the early nineteenth century, it eventually abolished the slave trade and then slavery itself. Financial compensation went to slave owners, not the enslaved. Trekboers, facing the loss of what they saw as “their” labor, seethed with resentment. The Great Trek, in which thousands of Boers left the colony to establish their own republics in the interior, cannot be understood without this labor crisis. Their departure was, among other things, a search for new land and new, more controllable sources of African labor.

Thus, from the very beginning, labor sat at the center of colonial conflict: between European powers and indigenous polities, between settlers and imperial authorities, and between enslaved or coerced workers and those who claimed to own them. The economic importance of labor shaped political decisions, territorial expansion, and cultural change.

The Mineral Revolution: Diamonds, gold, and the industrial discipline of African labor

If slavery and frontier coercion created a colonial economy, the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley in 1867 and gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886 created something else entirely: a deep, industrial, export-oriented mining economy that transformed South Africa into a crucial node in global capitalism.

These minerals were buried deep underground and required enormous amounts of capital, engineering knowledge, and—most of all—labor. You could not casually dig gold out of reefs thousands of meters below the surface with a few farmhands. Mining houses needed thousands upon thousands of workers, willing to endure dangerous conditions for low pay, and ideally unable to easily leave.

On the surface, this looked like an opportunity for African men. The mines offered cash wages that could be used to pay colonial taxes, purchase goods, and gain status at home. But the system that emerged was designed to ensure that this new wage labor would benefit the mines and the colonial/imperial state far more than the workers.

Several features of the mining labor system show just how central labor was to South Africa’s path.

First, the migrant labor system. Instead of creating a permanent urban African working class with families in the cities, mining capitalists and the state opted for a system in which African men were recruited from rural areas and neighboring territories for fixed contracts, then sent back “home” after their work stint. This arrangement had multiple advantages for capital and the state. It externalized the cost of reproducing the labor force onto rural families and reserves. It reduced the risk of permanent African urban settlement and political organization. And it allowed wages to be kept extremely low, because workers’ survival was supplemented by subsistence production at home.

Second, tight control of workers’ daily lives. On the mines, African laborers were housed in compounds—enclosed barracks whose stated purpose included preventing diamond theft but which also served to monitor, discipline, and segregate workers. Pass laws restricted movement; contract systems limited bargaining power. Occupational hierarchies were drawn along racial lines: whites did skilled, supervisory work at much higher wages; blacks did most of the hard, dangerous physical labor deep underground.

Third, state support for labor control. As the mining industry grew, the colonial state reoriented itself around the needs of capital. Laws regulated black workers’ movement, criminalized breaches of contract, and helped guarantee the steady flow of labor from rural “reserves” and neighboring colonies. Police and military power backed up this legal framework.

The mineral revolution turned labor into a national question. African people were increasingly drawn into the wage economy, not because they freely chose to abandon subsistence livelihoods, but because their ability to survive independently was systematically undermined. Land dispossession, livestock disease, taxation, and the erosion of rural economies pushed men into migrant labor. Their work, in turn, generated enormous profits that flowed to a small minority of shareholders and bolstered the political power of both English-speaking capital and Afrikaner farmers.

Labor here did triple duty. Economically, it generated the surplus that made South Africa strategically important to global capitalism. Politically, the discipline of African labor and the alliance between mining capital and Afrikaner agrarian interests laid the foundation for a state designed to manage a large, disenfranchised workforce. Socially, migrant labor fractured families, reconfigured gender roles (with women left in the countryside bearing the weight of survival), and created a new class of urban, yet not fully urban, African workers whose lives were split between compound and rural home.

This system was not a side effect of mining; it was the core technology that made the mining economy possible.

Glen Grey and the rural engineering of a labor supply

The mines’ hunger for workers created pressure to reshape rural societies. The Glen Grey district in the Eastern Cape provides a window into how colonial authorities and white politicians tried to “design” a labor force by manipulating land, taxation, and legal status.

By the late nineteenth century, parts of the Eastern Cape contained relatively dense African communities farming on land that had not yet been fully alienated to white settlers. Some African farmers, including many Thembu, had become quite successful, producing crops for markets, accumulating livestock, and maintaining a degree of autonomy. For white politicians and farmers who saw these communities as both a land problem and a labor problem, this was unacceptable.

The Glen Grey Act of 1894, often associated with Cecil Rhodes, targeted this situation. Nominally, it introduced individual title over small plots of land to African male household heads in the district. In practice, it did several things that were all about labor.

It restricted land holdings to small, fixed plots, making it impossible for extended families to expand their holdings as they grew. It prohibited subletting and squatting, limiting the ability of land-poor families to remain in the area. And it paired land rights with new taxes—on land holdings, on men deemed “able-bodied,” and in some cases on employers—payable in cash.

The logic was clear: squeeze people off the land and into the labor market. If families could no longer sustain themselves on their plots, and if they owed taxes that could only be paid in money, then men would be compelled to seek wages on white farms, in towns, or in the mines. Those who left to work outside the district for portions of the year could receive partial relief from some of the taxes, making migration an attractive, or at least necessary, option.

In this sense, the Glen Grey Act was less about granting land and more about weaponizing it. Land became a tool to sort the population: a limited number of smallholders and a much larger pool of landless or land-poor people who had little choice but to sell their labor under unfavorable conditions. This pattern, extended and hardened in later land acts and the creation of “native reserves” and “homelands,” meant that South Africa’s racial order was literally built into the landscape.

Here, again, the importance of labor is obvious. Political elites were not primarily trying to eliminate African farming; they were trying to subordinate it so that it would feed the wage labor system. The rural economy was reshaped to complement mines and white farms, not to stand alongside them as an equal. Labor was the missing piece they were engineering toward: enough dependence on wages to guarantee a supply of workers, but enough rural subsistence left to subsidize the low wages employers wanted to pay.

This rural engineering reveals how deeply questions of labor penetrated statecraft. The colonial and, later, Union government treated African people not as citizens with rights, but as potential workers whose availability needed to be managed through land, law, and tax policy.

Apartheid, manufacturing, and the Durban strikes of 1973

By the mid-twentieth century, South Africa had moved beyond being just a mining and agricultural economy. Manufacturing expanded, especially in and around cities like Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town. The apartheid state, which came to power in 1948, tried to square a circle: it wanted the benefits of industrialization and cheap black labor without giving up racial control.

Apartheid laws tightened pass systems, locked Africans into ethnically defined “homelands,” and restricted where they could live and work in the so-called “white” areas. The state imagined black workers as temporary sojourners, not urban citizens. But factories, docks, and construction sites depended on their labor day in and day out. This contradiction made workplaces a key site of struggle.

Durban in the early 1970s was one of the places where that tension snapped. African workers in industries like textiles, metalworking, and brickmaking were paid extremely low wages and faced harsh conditions. Formal unions for black workers were largely banned. Management and apartheid officials assumed that repression, fragmentation, and the daily grind would keep workers quiet.

In early 1973, that assumption collapsed. Thousands of African workers went on strike, starting in key factories and spreading rapidly. They downed tools, marched, and demanded higher wages and recognition of their grievances. Without formal union structures, much of this organizing happened through informal networks, community ties, and workplace leadership. The strikes were risky: participants faced arrest, dismissal, and police brutality. Yet they spread, indicating a deep undercurrent of anger and a growing sense of collective power.

Why were these strikes so significant in the longer history of labor?

First, they marked a clear shift from rural and episodic resistance to sustained, urban, workplace-based struggle. Migrant and rural laborers had resisted for generations—through slowdowns, desertion, arson, and direct confrontation—but the Durban strikes put industrial workers at the center of anti-apartheid activism in a new way.

Second, they helped revive and reshape the trade union movement under apartheid. Out of these struggles grew new unions and eventually federations that would play a central role in opposing the regime in the 1980s. The popular image of anti-apartheid struggle as being primarily about students and political organizations only tells part of the story; organized labor was crucial in making the country ungovernable.

Third, the strikes exposed the economic vulnerability of the apartheid state. Apartheid ideology tried to portray black people as a “burden” or a “threat” to white prosperity. In reality, the economy depended on their labor. When workers withheld that labor, production stalled, exports were threatened, and profits dropped. This made it clear that political domination rested on an exploitative economic foundation that was not invincible.

Finally, the Durban strikes showed how labor issues and broader demands for dignity, equality, and political voice were intertwined. Workers did not just want a few extra rand; they wanted recognition as human beings, not as “boys” or disposable cogs in the machine. Workplaces became spaces where people learned to organize, debate, and imagine alternatives.

In this period, labor was not only an economic resource to be controlled; it became a weapon that workers themselves wielded against the apartheid state.

Mandeni, unemployment, and the social crisis of the late twentieth century

If the early colonial and industrial periods were marked by a voracious demand for African labor, the late twentieth century brought a bitter irony: mass unemployment. As South Africa moved through the crisis of late apartheid and into the democratic era, many areas, especially in KwaZulu-Natal and the old homelands, became home to large populations of people who were no longer needed as workers but were still living with the after-effects of a system built around their exploitation.

Mandeni, an industrial-residential area on the North Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, illustrates this shift. The region had grown around factories, plantations, and migrant labor flows. By the 1990s and early 2000s, however, deindustrialization, mechanization, and broader economic restructuring meant that many people either could not find work or were trapped in precarious, low-paid jobs.

Unemployment was not just a matter of having no paycheck; it was the collapse of a whole way of organizing life. In a context where men had long been expected to migrate for wages to support rural homes, the disappearance of those jobs undercut gender roles, household structures, and local economies. Young people came of age in communities where the old promise—work hard, go to the mines or factories, send money home—no longer held.

At the same time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic hit areas like Mandeni with devastating force. Wage labor and migrant patterns had long disrupted family life, contributed to multiple partnering, and created networks in which infections could spread rapidly. When people lost work or remained stuck in informal, insecure employment, they also lost access to whatever limited workplace-based health care or social support had existed. The burden of care fell on women, grandmothers, and already stretched households.

In this stage of South Africa’s story, the importance of labor is revealed in its absence. For generations, African lives had been organized around the demands of capital and the state for their work. When that demand shrank, it did not automatically produce freedom. It produced a kind of abandonment: people were still fenced in by the legacies of land dispossession, poor education, and spatial segregation, but they were no longer even “needed” as workers.

The social and health crises around Mandeni show that exploitation and exclusion are two sides of the same coin. The mining compounds and rural reserves of an earlier era had always offloaded costs onto black households; in the post-apartheid era, when the labor system shed people, those same households were left to absorb the shock with minimal state support. Labor, again, was central—not as a simple story of work or no work, but as the organizing principle of a society that had been built to extract value and then struggled to imagine how to sustain people once that extraction slowed or shifted.

Labor as the through-line of South African history

Looking across these moments—the slave lodge in Cape Town, the diamond and gold mines, the Glen Grey land regime, the Durban strikes, and the crisis of unemployment and disease—what emerges is not a series of disconnected episodes, but a coherent pattern.

First, labor was the primary way in which colonial and later apartheid authorities interacted with African people. Whether through slavery, coerced Khoisan servitude, hut and labor taxes, pass laws, or contract systems, the state’s central concern was how to get people to work, where, for whom, and at what price. Citizenship, rights, and political participation were secondary or actively suppressed.

Second, control over labor and control over land went hand in hand. Dispossession, the creation of reserves and homelands, and laws like the Glen Grey Act were not only about territory. They were about making independent survival difficult enough that wage labor became necessary, while still keeping rural economies alive enough to subsidize low wages. The geography of South Africa—crowded rural former reserves, sprawling townships, industrial cores—is a map of labor control as much as anything else.

Third, the racial order was anchored in the division of labor. Whiteness carried with it the expectation of certain kinds of work (skilled, supervisory, or managerial) and certain kinds of leisure; blackness was associated with manual, dangerous, and underpaid work—or with unemployment and informality. This was not just social prejudice; it was codified in job reservation, wage scales, and education policies designed to produce “hewers of wood and drawers of water.” The South African variant of capitalism was racial to its core.

Fourth, labor was not only something imposed on people; it was also the ground on which they resisted. Enslaved people sabotaged, fled, or negotiated. Khoisan and other African communities fought frontier wars and engaged in everyday defiance. Mineworkers struck, formed clandestine unions, and used the compound system’s enforced proximity to build solidarity. Industrial workers in Durban and elsewhere transformed grievances over wages into broader challenges to apartheid. Even in an era of mass unemployment, people in places like Mandeni organized around access to water, health care, and grants, insisting that their lives mattered even when the labor market said otherwise.

Finally, the legacies of these labor regimes are not past tense. Contemporary South Africa’s extreme inequality, high unemployment, and persistent racialized poverty all trace back to how work was organized and valued under colonialism and apartheid. The fact that millions still live far from economic centers, in former “homelands” with weak infrastructure, is not an accident; it is the residue of a system that treated their ancestors primarily as a labor reserve.

To talk about the importance of labor in the South African colonies is therefore to talk about almost everything: land, race, gender, family, health, urbanization, and political struggle. Labor was the hinge on which the colonial project turned, the engine that powered both economic growth and social devastation, and the tool that both rulers and the ruled tried to wield.

If there is a thread of hope in this story, it lies in the fact that the same work that was used to exploit also created the conditions for solidarity. People who were forced together in slave lodges, compounds, hostels, and factories forged languages, cultures, and movements that eventually helped bring down apartheid. The challenge for the present—and the future—is whether South Africa can build an economy and society in which labor is not a marker of racial domination or a privilege hoarded by the few, but a basis for shared dignity and a more equal life for all.
