Long before European ships appeared off the Cape, work, power, and survival in southern Africa were already tightly bound together. Communities organized themselves around scarce water, pasture, and grazing routes. A Kgosi’s authority rested not only on lineage or charisma, but on the ability to call on the ancestors and bring rain, pula. Cattle functioned as currency, kinship glue, and spiritual anchor all at once—“modimo o nko e metsi,” the god with the wet nose. Control over herds, grazing lands, and people’s labor underpinned status and authority. In other words, the foundations of political power were economic, and the foundations of the economy were labor.

At roughly the same time, far away, European empires were knitting the world together through trade routes, extraction, and conquest. The Dutch East India Company did not sail to the Cape in 1652 because it was curious about African societies; it came because ships needed to be fed, watered, and repaired on their way to Asia. When that commercial outpost at Table Bay collided with indigenous societies whose wealth was measured in cattle and people’s work, it set off a chain of transformations that would make labor the central axis of South African history.

From the slave lodge in early Cape Town to the diamond pits of Kimberley and the deep-level gold mines of the Witwatersrand, from the Glen Grey Act’s calculated “creation” of rural laborers to the Durban strikes of the 1970s and the mass unemployment and AIDS crisis in places like Mandeni at the end of apartheid, labor was never just an economic variable. It was the main lever through which land was taken, racial categories hardened, families reshaped, and resistance organized. To understand the making of South Africa, you have to follow the work: who did it, under what conditions, for whose benefit, and with what consequences.

This essay traces that story across several key moments and sites. It begins with slavery and coerced labor in the early Cape Colony, moves through the mineral revolution and the emergence of a migrant labor system, examines rural reengineering under the Glen Grey Act, looks at the explosion of worker resistance in Durban in 1973, and ends with the social wreckage of mass unemployment and disease around Mandeni in the late twentieth century. Across this arc, the argument is simple but far-reaching: South Africa’s political and social order was built, maintained, and ultimately destabilized through struggles over labor.

Early Cape Colony: Slavery, coerced work, and the making of a colonial labor force

When the Dutch East India Company established its refreshment station at the Cape, it had a straightforward problem: how to get food, fuel, and services at minimal cost from a place where European labor was scarce and expensive. The solution—predictable in the seventeenth-century Atlantic world—was slavery.

The Slave Lodge in Cape Town became the beating heart of this system. It was more than just a building; it was an experiment in compressing human diversity into a controllable labor force. Enslaved people were imported from East Africa, Madagascar, India, Southeast Asia, and other VOC possessions. Inside the lodge, these captives cooked, cleaned, built, tended gardens, and serviced the needs of officials. Outside, enslaved labor spread onto settler farms, workshops, and urban households.

Labor’s importance here appears in at least three ways.

First, slavery solved an economic bottleneck. The colony’s viability depended on a cheap and dependable workforce to produce grain, meat, wine, and other provisioning goods. Enslaved people’s bodies were turned into infrastructure: they terraced hillsides for vineyards, dug canals, built roads, and maintained the very outpost that anchored Dutch trade routes.

Second, the slave system reordered society and identity. With time, the enslaved population outnumbered free Europeans in the colony. Relationships—violent, coerced, but also intimate and everyday—between enslaved people, Khoisan, and European settlers produced new languages (Afrikaans emerging partly as a contact language), cuisines, and communities. Racial categories hardened in law in order to fix who could own labor and who could be owned. Slavery racialized labor, and labor solidified race.

Third, the practice of coercing labor at the Cape did not stop at the boundaries of formal slavery. As settler agriculture expanded inland, trekboers increasingly captured, indebted, and coerced Khoisan people into servitude. Even when not legally enslaved, many Khoisan workers were trapped by systems of debt, pass requirements, and violence that functioned in practice like unfree labor. Labor control was the underlying problem the colonial state and settler society repeatedly tried to “solve,” and each solution left deeper marks on South African society.

When Britain took permanent control of the Cape in the early nineteenth century, it eventually abolished the slave trade and then slavery itself. Financial compensation went to slave owners, not the enslaved. Trekboers, facing the loss of what they saw as “their” labor, seethed with resentment. The Great Trek, in which thousands of Boers left the colony to establish their own republics in the interior, cannot be understood without this labor crisis. Their departure was, among other things, a search for new land and new, more controllable sources of African labor.

Thus, from the very beginning, labor sat at the center of colonial conflict: between European powers and indigenous polities, between settlers and imperial authorities, and between enslaved or coerced workers and those who claimed to own them. The economic importance of labor shaped political decisions, territorial expansion, and cultural change.

The Mineral Revolution: Diamonds, gold, and the industrial discipline of African labor

If slavery and frontier coercion created a colonial economy, the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley in 1867 and gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886 created something else entirely: a deep, industrial, export-oriented mining economy that transformed South Africa into a crucial node in global capitalism.

These minerals were buried deep underground and required enormous amounts of capital, engineering knowledge, and—most of all—labor. You could not casually dig gold out of reefs thousands of meters below the surface with a few farmhands. Mining houses needed thousands upon thousands of workers, willing to endure dangerous conditions for low pay, and ideally unable to easily leave.

On the surface, this looked like an opportunity for African men. The mines offered cash wages that could be used to pay colonial taxes, purchase goods, and gain status at home. But the system that emerged was designed to ensure that this new wage labor would benefit the mines and the colonial/imperial state far more than the workers.

Several features of the mining labor system show just how central labor was to South Africa’s path.

First, the migrant labor system. Instead of creating a permanent urban African working class with families in the cities, mining capitalists and the state opted for a system in which African men were recruited from rural areas and neighboring territories for fixed contracts, then sent back “home” after their work stint. This arrangement had multiple advantages for capital and the state. It externalized the cost of reproducing the labor force onto rural families and reserves. It reduced the risk of permanent African urban settlement and political organization. And it allowed wages to be kept extremely low, because workers’ survival was supplemented by subsistence production at home.

Second, tight control of workers’ daily lives. On the mines, African laborers were housed in compounds—enclosed barracks whose stated purpose included preventing diamond theft but which also served to monitor, discipline, and segregate workers. Pass laws restricted movement; contract systems limited bargaining power. Occupational hierarchies were drawn along racial lines: whites did skilled, supervisory work at much higher wages; blacks did most of the hard, dangerous physical labor deep underground.

Third, state support for labor control. As the mining industry grew, the colonial state reoriented itself around the needs of capital. Laws regulated black workers’ movement, criminalized breaches of contract, and helped guarantee the steady flow of labor from rural “reserves” and neighboring colonies. Police and military power backed up this legal framework.

The mineral revolution turned labor into a national question. African people were increasingly drawn into the wage economy, not because they freely chose to abandon subsistence livelihoods, but because their ability to survive independently was systematically undermined. Land dispossession, livestock disease, taxation, and the erosion of rural economies pushed men into migrant labor. Their work, in turn, generated enormous profits that flowed to a small minority of shareholders and bolstered the political power of both English-speaking capital and Afrikaner farmers.

Labor here did triple duty. Economically, it generated the surplus that made South Africa strategically important to global capitalism. Politically, the discipline of African labor and the alliance between mining capital and Afrikaner agrarian interests laid the foundation for a state designed to manage a large, disenfranchised workforce. Socially, migrant labor fractured families, reconfigured gender roles (with women left in the countryside bearing the weight of survival), and created a new class of urban, yet not fully urban, African workers whose lives were split between compound and rural home.

This system was not a side effect of mining; it was the core technology that made the mining economy possible.

Glen Grey and the rural engineering of a labor supply

The mines’ hunger for workers created pressure to reshape rural societies. The Glen Grey district in the Eastern Cape provides a window into how colonial authorities and white politicians tried to “design” a labor force by manipulating land, taxation, and legal status.

By the late nineteenth century, parts of the Eastern Cape contained relatively dense African communities farming on land that had not yet been fully alienated to white settlers. Some African farmers, including many Thembu, had become quite successful, producing crops for markets, accumulating livestock, and maintaining a degree of autonomy. For white politicians and farmers who saw these communities as both a land problem and a labor problem, this was unacceptable.

The Glen Grey Act of 1894, often associated with Cecil Rhodes, targeted this situation. Nominally, it introduced individual title over small plots of land to African male household heads in the district. In practice, it did several things that were all about labor.

It restricted land holdings to small, fixed plots, making it impossible for extended families to expand their holdings as they grew. It prohibited subletting and squatting, limiting the ability of land-poor families to remain in the area. And it paired land rights with new taxes—on land holdings, on men deemed “able-bodied,” and in some cases on employers—payable in cash.

The logic was clear: squeeze people off the land and into the labor market. If families could no longer sustain themselves on their plots, and if they owed taxes that could only be paid in money, then men would be compelled to seek wages on white farms, in towns, or in the mines. Those who left to work outside the district for portions of the year could receive partial relief from some of the taxes, making migration an attractive, or at least necessary, option.

In this sense, the Glen Grey Act was less about granting land and more about weaponizing it. Land became a tool to sort the population: a limited number of smallholders and a much larger pool of landless or land-poor people who had little choice but to sell their labor under unfavorable conditions. This pattern, extended and hardened in later land acts and the creation of “native reserves” and “homelands,” meant that South Africa’s racial order was literally built into the landscape.

Here, again, the importance of labor is obvious. Political elites were not primarily trying to eliminate African farming; they were trying to subordinate it so that it would feed the wage labor system. The rural economy was reshaped to complement mines and white farms, not to stand alongside them as an equal. Labor was the missing piece they were engineering toward: enough dependence on wages to guarantee a supply of workers, but enough rural subsistence left to subsidize the low wages employers wanted to pay.

This rural engineering reveals how deeply questions of labor penetrated statecraft. The colonial and, later, Union government treated African people not as citizens with rights, but as potential workers whose availability needed to be managed through land, law, and tax policy.

Apartheid, manufacturing, and the Durban strikes of 1973

By the mid-twentieth century, South Africa had moved beyond being just a mining and agricultural economy. Manufacturing expanded, especially in and around cities like Johannesburg, Durban, and Cape Town. The apartheid state, which came to power in 1948, tried to square a circle: it wanted the benefits of industrialization and cheap black labor without giving up racial control.

Apartheid laws tightened pass systems, locked Africans into ethnically defined “homelands,” and restricted where they could live and work in the so-called “white” areas. The state imagined black workers as temporary sojourners, not urban citizens. But factories, docks, and construction sites depended on their labor day in and day out. This contradiction made workplaces a key site of struggle.

Durban in the early 1970s was one of the places where that tension snapped. African workers in industries like textiles, metalworking, and brickmaking were paid extremely low wages and faced harsh conditions. Formal unions for black workers were largely banned. Management and apartheid officials assumed that repression, fragmentation, and the daily grind would keep workers quiet.

In early 1973, that assumption collapsed. Thousands of African workers went on strike, starting in key factories and spreading rapidly. They downed tools, marched, and demanded higher wages and recognition of their grievances. Without formal union structures, much of this organizing happened through informal networks, community ties, and workplace leadership. The strikes were risky: participants faced arrest, dismissal, and police brutality. Yet they spread, indicating a deep undercurrent of anger and a growing sense of collective power.

Why were these strikes so significant in the longer history of labor?

First, they marked a clear shift from rural and episodic resistance to sustained, urban, workplace-based struggle. Migrant and rural laborers had resisted for generations—through slowdowns, desertion, arson, and direct confrontation—but the Durban strikes put industrial workers at the center of anti-apartheid activism in a new way.

Second, they helped revive and reshape the trade union movement under apartheid. Out of these struggles grew new unions and eventually federations that would play a central role in opposing the regime in the 1980s. The popular image of anti-apartheid struggle as being primarily about students and political organizations only tells part of the story; organized labor was crucial in making the country ungovernable.

Third, the strikes exposed the economic vulnerability of the apartheid state. Apartheid ideology tried to portray black people as a “burden” or a “threat” to white prosperity. In reality, the economy depended on their labor. When workers withheld that labor, production stalled, exports were threatened, and profits dropped. This made it clear that political domination rested on an exploitative economic foundation that was not invincible.

Finally, the Durban strikes showed how labor issues and broader demands for dignity, equality, and political voice were intertwined. Workers did not just want a few extra rand; they wanted recognition as human beings, not as “boys” or disposable cogs in the machine. Workplaces became spaces where people learned to organize, debate, and imagine alternatives.

In this period, labor was not only an economic resource to be controlled; it became a weapon that workers themselves wielded against the apartheid state.

Mandeni, unemployment, and the social crisis of the late twentieth century

If the early colonial and industrial periods were marked by a voracious demand for African labor, the late twentieth century brought a bitter irony: mass unemployment. As South Africa moved through the crisis of late apartheid and into the democratic era, many areas, especially in KwaZulu-Natal and the old homelands, became home to large populations of people who were no longer needed as workers but were still living with the after-effects of a system built around their exploitation.

Mandeni, an industrial-residential area on the North Coast of KwaZulu-Natal, illustrates this shift. The region had grown around factories, plantations, and migrant labor flows. By the 1990s and early 2000s, however, deindustrialization, mechanization, and broader economic restructuring meant that many people either could not find work or were trapped in precarious, low-paid jobs.

Unemployment was not just a matter of having no paycheck; it was the collapse of a whole way of organizing life. In a context where men had long been expected to migrate for wages to support rural homes, the disappearance of those jobs undercut gender roles, household structures, and local economies. Young people came of age in communities where the old promise—work hard, go to the mines or factories, send money home—no longer held.

At the same time, the HIV/AIDS epidemic hit areas like Mandeni with devastating force. Wage labor and migrant patterns had long disrupted family life, contributed to multiple partnering, and created networks in which infections could spread rapidly. When people lost work or remained stuck in informal, insecure employment, they also lost access to whatever limited workplace-based health care or social support had existed. The burden of care fell on women, grandmothers, and already stretched households.

In this stage of South Africa’s story, the importance of labor is revealed in its absence. For generations, African lives had been organized around the demands of capital and the state for their work. When that demand shrank, it did not automatically produce freedom. It produced a kind of abandonment: people were still fenced in by the legacies of land dispossession, poor education, and spatial segregation, but they were no longer even “needed” as workers.

The social and health crises around Mandeni show that exploitation and exclusion are two sides of the same coin. The mining compounds and rural reserves of an earlier era had always offloaded costs onto black households; in the post-apartheid era, when the labor system shed people, those same households were left to absorb the shock with minimal state support. Labor, again, was central—not as a simple story of work or no work, but as the organizing principle of a society that had been built to extract value and then struggled to imagine how to sustain people once that extraction slowed or shifted.

Labor as the through-line of South African history

Looking across these moments—the slave lodge in Cape Town, the diamond and gold mines, the Glen Grey land regime, the Durban strikes, and the crisis of unemployment and disease—what emerges is not a series of disconnected episodes, but a coherent pattern.

First, labor was the primary way in which colonial and later apartheid authorities interacted with African people. Whether through slavery, coerced Khoisan servitude, hut and labor taxes, pass laws, or contract systems, the state’s central concern was how to get people to work, where, for whom, and at what price. Citizenship, rights, and political participation were secondary or actively suppressed.

Second, control over labor and control over land went hand in hand. Dispossession, the creation of reserves and homelands, and laws like the Glen Grey Act were not only about territory. They were about making independent survival difficult enough that wage labor became necessary, while still keeping rural economies alive enough to subsidize low wages. The geography of South Africa—crowded rural former reserves, sprawling townships, industrial cores—is a map of labor control as much as anything else.

Third, the racial order was anchored in the division of labor. Whiteness carried with it the expectation of certain kinds of work (skilled, supervisory, or managerial) and certain kinds of leisure; blackness was associated with manual, dangerous, and underpaid work—or with unemployment and informality. This was not just social prejudice; it was codified in job reservation, wage scales, and education policies designed to produce “hewers of wood and drawers of water.” The South African variant of capitalism was racial to its core.

Fourth, labor was not only something imposed on people; it was also the ground on which they resisted. Enslaved people sabotaged, fled, or negotiated. Khoisan and other African communities fought frontier wars and engaged in everyday defiance. Mineworkers struck, formed clandestine unions, and used the compound system’s enforced proximity to build solidarity. Industrial workers in Durban and elsewhere transformed grievances over wages into broader challenges to apartheid. Even in an era of mass unemployment, people in places like Mandeni organized around access to water, health care, and grants, insisting that their lives mattered even when the labor market said otherwise.

Finally, the legacies of these labor regimes are not past tense. Contemporary South Africa’s extreme inequality, high unemployment, and persistent racialized poverty all trace back to how work was organized and valued under colonialism and apartheid. The fact that millions still live far from economic centers, in former “homelands” with weak infrastructure, is not an accident; it is the residue of a system that treated their ancestors primarily as a labor reserve.

To talk about the importance of labor in the South African colonies is therefore to talk about almost everything: land, race, gender, family, health, urbanization, and political struggle. Labor was the hinge on which the colonial project turned, the engine that powered both economic growth and social devastation, and the tool that both rulers and the ruled tried to wield.

If there is a thread of hope in this story, it lies in the fact that the same work that was used to exploit also created the conditions for solidarity. People who were forced together in slave lodges, compounds, hostels, and factories forged languages, cultures, and movements that eventually helped bring down apartheid. The challenge for the present—and the future—is whether South Africa can build an economy and society in which labor is not a marker of racial domination or a privilege hoarded by the few, but a basis for shared dignity and a more equal life for all.
