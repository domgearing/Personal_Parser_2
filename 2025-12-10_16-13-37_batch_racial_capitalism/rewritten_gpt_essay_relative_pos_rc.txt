Capitalism relies on inequity as fuel, not as an accident or mistake. Prosperity for a few has historically depended on exploiting groups marked by race. By racializing people, societies decided who benefits, who works, and who is marginalized. Normalization makes ongoing racial inequality seem ordinary instead of engineered. The rise of capitalism cannot be understood without its racialized labor systems. Supposedly objective disciplines have sometimes helped uphold racial capitalism. Power is the starting point for analyzing racial capitalism. Power is centralized among capital holders. In a fair system, economic mobility would allow anyone to rise through effort and innovation. Long before now, opportunities were distributed unfairly. Systems like slavery and colonialism enriched elites while trapping others in deprivation. The U.S. policing and prison system offers a clear illustration. Slavery was outlawed—except when someone was convicted of a crime. The exception was designed, not accidental. It created a direct pathway for slavery to continue in a new form. Corporations benefited from the re-enslavement of freed Black citizens through bogus arrests. Once again, Black people’s bodies fueled economic growth through captivity. Inequality persisted by reshaping itself to match new rules. The pattern repeated itself years later under the banner of “law and order.” Harsh drug policies punished heavily in the communities least protected from poverty and systemic neglect. Crack was punished more harshly than cocaine used by affluent white people. Economic gain—more prisoners, more money—drove policy under a disguise of safety. Profit thrived because of injustice, not despite it. Racial capitalism also operates in ordinary, less noticeable spaces. The subtle moments of life reveal the same logic. In places such as Ferguson, tiny violations became cash sources taken mostly from poor Black residents. One small fine could escalate into major financial and legal crises. The system penalizes poverty by making people poorer. The poor become a source of profit. One person’s fight to survive becomes another’s profit. The same logic extends into healthcare, housing, schooling — every domain where resources are distributed unevenly and those with the fewest resources have the highest costs. In medical settings, whose pain is believed? Whose health concerns are not taken seriously? The healthcare economy rewards treating those who can afford it, worsening outcomes for Black patients. Discriminatory housing laws deprived Black families of wealth opportunities and environmental safety. Education frequently reinforces class and racial structures instead of disrupting them. What this is suggests is that where psychology enters the conversation. Ideally, psychology exists to support and explain human well-being. Yet historically, psychology often aligned with the powerful. Racism hid behind claims of science — IQ tests, anatomical theories, psychiatry. The message was that inequality comes from “natural” inferiority—not injustice. Psychological “expertise” was used to justify segregation, forced assimilation, and discrimination under the guise of objectivity. Psychologists blamed the oppressed instead of the structures crushing them. The narrative made structural violence look like personal failure. History’s wounds were reframed as individual weaknesses. Those in control avoided scrutiny. The oppressed were studied as problems rather than partners. Not every scholar went along with the oppressive narrative. These schools of thought expose how research can either uphold or dismantle oppression. This method centers ordinary people as the main drivers of historical change. The labor and resistance of oppressed groups are core historical forces. Viewing history through their eyes transforms our understanding of “advancement.” Extraction and inequality, not innovation alone, generated today’s wealth. Liberation Psychology takes a similar turn in a different field. The approach investigates external injustice as the root of suffering. Healing means altering the world, not pretending it’s fine. Instead of adapting people to injustice, it targets the injustice. The narrative is completely turned around. The marginalized perspective becomes the primary truth, not a side note. Racial capitalism isn’t just a historical topic. We must see that the same dynamics still shape society now. Low-wage gig work creates profit while denying workers protections. The economic map still mirrors the old color lines. Political campaigns rely on racial fear to win votes that protect elite financial interests. Mental health disorders rise in communities living under constant stress, and the burden is placed on individuals to cope while the structural causes remain intact. We also need to understand that racism adapts. It often hides in subtlety. Policies and norms present as objective often yield racial disparities. Its subtlety gives it staying power. Exploitation is masked by claims of equality. It convinces society that success is simply a matter of effort, even when the ground is tilted so steeply that climbing is nearly impossible for some and effortless for others. The task now isn’t to collect more evidence — we’ve done that. Applying that understanding is the real test. Psychology has an opportunity here to shift fully away from its past role as a tool of justification and toward a future focused on empowerment. Scientists investigate how inequity impacts brains, emotions, and sense of self. We are learning exactly how inequality translates into harm. What this knowledge suggests is that can become a tool for change if we let it. Some changes are already visible. Community-based mental health programs challenge the idea that help must come from experts outside the community. Research uncovers the creation of bias and strategies to dismantle it. It teaches that suffering comes from inequality, not individual deficiency. Students learn that what exists now was constructed — and can be reconstructed. Still, awareness is only the first step. Its strength lies in structural and psychological entanglements. The damage runs too deep for simple or short reforms. Change begins by centering the lived realities of the harmed. Stories told by the powerful alone ensure injustice stays disguised. The real issue is imagining the world we’re trying to create. Security for the few at the expense of many is doomed to fail. Wealth built on someone else’s pain isn’t progress at all. Values like dignity and opportunity must be built into our economic structure. That requires re-examining the foundations rather than patching up the visible cracks. Inequality is baked into racial capitalism by design. These approaches remind us that systems can be rebuilt when the oppressed reclaim the story. Psychology’s role must be to support that process, not obstruct it. History’s purpose must be to uncover the truth rather than protect the comfortable. There is still a long way to go. Understanding the connection arms us with critical language. Hearing the oppressed inspires action to end injustice. Their human origins oblige us to reimagine them. The legacy of racial capitalism should stop with us, not continue onward.
