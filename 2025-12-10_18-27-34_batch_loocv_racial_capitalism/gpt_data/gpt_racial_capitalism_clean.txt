Racial capitalism begins with a simple but unsettling idea: inequality is not a flaw in capitalist systems, but one of their engines.
The creation of wealth for some requires the exploitation of others, and throughout history those “others” have been defined along racial lines.
Race became a tool for sorting human beings into categories of economic value — who would profit, who would labor, who would be controlled, who would be discarded.
The consequences of this arrangement have shaped centuries of social reality, and they continue to define everyday life in ways that are easy to overlook because they have been so thoroughly normalized.
When you examine the history closely, capitalism’s growth is inseparable from the commodification of racialized groups.
And the institutions that claim to study human behavior and society — history, science, psychology — have often worked to reinforce rather than challenge these structures.
To understand racial capitalism, we have to begin with power.
Capitalism concentrates power in the hands of those who own and control resources.
In a fair system, economic mobility would allow anyone to rise through effort and innovation.
But history shows that the playing field was uneven long before the game began.
Slavery, colonial extraction, segregation, discriminatory policy, and policing did more than limit opportunity — they generated enormous wealth for those at the top while structurally withholding it from those at the bottom.
One of the most striking examples comes from the history of American law enforcement and incarceration.
After the end of slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment famously prohibited forced labor — except as punishment for a crime.
That loophole was not an oversight.
It created a direct pathway for slavery to continue in a new form.
Black Americans, newly freed from plantation labor, were arrested on vague charges like vagrancy or “suspicious behavior,” then leased out to corporations and industries that needed cheap labor.
Incarceration became profitable, and Black bodies once again became instruments of economic expansion.
The racial hierarchy had not disappeared; it had simply adapted to the legal system of a capitalist democracy.
The pattern repeated itself years later under the banner of “law and order.” Harsh drug policies punished heavily in the communities least protected from poverty and systemic neglect.
Crack cocaine — associated with Black neighborhoods — carried sentences far more severe than powder cocaine — linked to wealthier, whiter users.
The justification, framed as science and public safety, masked an economic logic: prisons filled, private contracts expanded, police departments gained funding, municipalities collected fines.
Inequality was not incidental; it was profitable.
These mechanisms are not confined to the most dramatic examples of imprisonment or legislation.
Sometimes they appear in the small details of daily life.
In cities like Ferguson, Missouri, minor infractions — jaywalking, a broken tail light, missing paperwork — became opportunities for local governments to extract money from residents, who were disproportionately Black and poor.
A single unpaid ticket could snowball into hundreds of dollars in fees, arrest warrants, and job-threatening legal troubles.
When people cannot pay, they are punished; when they are punished, they are charged even more.
Poverty becomes a revenue stream.
Racial capitalism turns the struggle for survival into someone else’s gain.
The same logic extends into healthcare, housing, schooling — every domain where resources are distributed unevenly and those with the fewest resources have the highest costs.
In medical settings, whose pain is believed?
Whose symptoms are dismissed?
Studies repeatedly show that Black patients receive poorer treatment than white patients, both due to bias and because the financial incentives of the U.S. healthcare system prioritize those who can pay more.
Housing policy historically pushed Black families into underfunded neighborhoods with limited opportunity and higher exposure to environmental hazards, while property values — and therefore wealth accumulation — flourished in white suburbs protected by racist zoning laws.
Even the most celebrated pillar of equality, education, has a hidden function: sorting students into economic roles that support the existing hierarchy.
This is where psychology enters the conversation.
Psychology should be a science dedicated to understanding and helping humans.
But for much of its history, it has served the interests of those who held power.
Scientific racism dressed prejudice in the language of intelligence testing, biology, and mental health.
It claimed that unequal outcomes reflected inherent differences rather than structural oppression.
Psychological “expertise” was used to justify segregation, forced assimilation, and discrimination under the guise of objectivity.
Instead of asking how society harms marginalized groups, psychology often asked what was wrong with those groups for struggling within harmful systems.
The result was a narrative that blamed the oppressed for the hardships imposed on them.
Generations of people were told that their suffering was the outcome of personal deficits, not historical violence.
The wealthy and powerful remained unquestioned.
The oppressed were studied as problems rather than partners.
Yet not all scholarship accepted this arrangement.
Movements like History from Below and Liberation Psychology emerged to confront the ways knowledge can either reinforce or challenge power.
History from Below shifts focus away from kings, nations, and powerful leaders toward the everyday people whose labor, resistance, and survival actually shape history.
It recognizes that the struggles of workers, enslaved people, and marginalized communities are not side notes — they are the foundation on which nations are built.
When you tell the story from their perspective, the image of progress looks very different.
The wealth of modern capitalism does not appear as the reward of innovation alone, but as the accumulated profit of extraction and exclusion.
Liberation Psychology takes a similar turn in a different field.
Instead of treating individuals as isolated minds with internal disorders, it examines how social structures harm mental wellbeing.
It recognizes that trauma, stress, and psychological suffering often stem from inequality — and that healing involves changing those systems, not forcing individuals to adapt to them.
Where traditional psychology asked how to help marginalized people function within oppressive realities, liberation psychology asks how to dismantle the oppression itself.
These approaches flip the script.
They say that the perspective of the oppressed is not an alternative version of the story; it is the truth that the dominant narrative worked to bury.
Understanding racial capitalism is not only about history.
It’s about recognizing how current systems continue to operate on the same principles.
Today, corporations profit from underpaid labor in gig economies where workers lack rights and stability.
Neighborhoods historically segregated still display predictable disparities in wealth and opportunity.
Political campaigns rely on racial fear to win votes that protect elite financial interests.
Mental health disorders rise in communities living under constant stress, and the burden is placed on individuals to cope while the structural causes remain intact.
We also need to understand that racism adapts.
It rarely announces itself openly.
It appears through economic policies, scientific claims, and cultural norms that feel “neutral” but produce racially unequal outcomes.
That is what makes racial capitalism so persistent.
It hides its exploitation behind the appearance of fairness.
It convinces society that success is simply a matter of effort, even when the ground is tilted so steeply that climbing is nearly impossible for some and effortless for others.
The challenge ahead is not simply documenting inequality — we have centuries of documentation already.
The challenge is deciding what to do with that knowledge.
Psychology has an opportunity here to shift fully away from its past role as a tool of justification and toward a future focused on empowerment.
Researchers are now studying how inequality affects cognitive development, mental health, stress responses, and identity.
They are identifying the pathways by which oppressive conditions produce harm.
This knowledge can become a tool for change if we let it.
There are signs of progress.
Community-based mental health programs challenge the idea that help must come from experts outside the community.
Social psychology experiments reveal how stereotypes are learned, how biases form, and how systems can be redesigned to reduce their impact.
Liberation psychology emphasizes collective action over individual coping, helping people recognize that their struggles are not evidence of personal failure but symptoms of unjust systems.
History from Below encourages students — the future leaders and voters and policymakers — to see that the world they accept today was created by human decisions, and human decisions can change it.
Still, awareness is only the first step.
Racial capitalism is deeply rooted, fueled by laws, profit structures, media narratives, and even the subconscious assumptions we inherit from the world around us.
There is no single policy that will undo its effects, no brief period of reform that will erase centuries of exploitation.
But shifting the lens — choosing to center the voices and experiences of those harmed by these systems — is a necessary beginning.
If society continues to learn history only from the perspective of conquerors and capitalism only from the perspective of beneficiaries, the injustice will stay invisible.
The question, ultimately, is what kind of world we want to build.
A system that requires some people to remain vulnerable for others to feel secure is not sustainable.
A form of prosperity that depends on the suffering of others cannot be considered progress.
If we believe that human beings deserve dignity, opportunity, and autonomy, then we need an economic system that reflects those values.
That requires re-examining the foundations rather than patching up the visible cracks.
Racial capitalism teaches us that inequality is not an accident — it is a design.
Liberation psychology and History from Below teach us that designs can be changed if the people they harm gain the ability to redefine the narrative.
Psychology’s role must be to support that process, not obstruct it.
History’s purpose must be to uncover the truth rather than protect the comfortable.
There is still a long way to go.
But naming the connection between capitalism and racial exploitation gives us the language needed to challenge it.
Listening to the stories of those who lived that exploitation gives us the motive to stop it.
And recognizing that systems are human creations gives us the responsibility to build something better.
If racial capitalism created the world we inherited, then our task now is to ensure it does not define the world we leave behind.
