{"orig":"Racial capitalism begins with a simple but unsettling idea: inequality is not a flaw in capitalist systems, but one of their engines.","cands":["Racial capitalism starts from the disturbing premise that inequality powers capitalism rather than undermines it.","Its core insight is that capitalism doesn’t malfunction when inequality appears—inequality actually keeps it running.","Capitalism relies on inequity as fuel, not as an accident or mistake."]}
{"orig":"The creation of wealth for some requires the exploitation of others, and throughout history those “others” have been defined along racial lines.","cands":["Prosperity for a few has historically depended on exploiting groups marked by race.","Wealth has repeatedly been built by extracting labor and value from racially targeted peoples.","Across eras, racialized exploitation has been the foundation for others’ financial gain."]}
{"orig":"Race became a tool for sorting human beings into categories of economic value — who would profit, who would labor, who would be controlled, who would be discarded.","cands":["Racial categories were invented to determine who gets privilege and who gets used.","Race functioned as a sorting system to assign economic roles and worth.","By racializing people, societies decided who benefits, who works, and who is marginalized."]}
{"orig":"The consequences of this arrangement have shaped centuries of social reality, and they continue to define everyday life in ways that are easy to overlook because they have been so thoroughly normalized.","cands":["These structures have shaped society for generations and still influence life today in invisible ways.","This system’s impacts are centuries old and remain embedded so deeply we barely notice them.","Normalization makes ongoing racial inequality seem ordinary instead of engineered."]}
{"orig":"When you examine the history closely, capitalism’s growth is inseparable from the commodification of racialized groups.","cands":["A deeper look at history reveals capitalism rose by turning racial groups into economic resources.","Capitalist expansion has always been tied to exploiting bodies marked by race.","The rise of capitalism cannot be understood without its racialized labor systems."]}
{"orig":"And the institutions that claim to study human behavior and society — history, science, psychology — have often worked to reinforce rather than challenge these structures.","cands":["Fields like history and psychology have frequently maintained, not questioned, these inequities.","Academic institutions have often validated racial hierarchies instead of dismantling them.","Supposedly objective disciplines have sometimes helped uphold racial capitalism."]}
{"orig":"To understand racial capitalism, we have to begin with power.","cands":["Power is the starting point for analyzing racial capitalism.","The concept must be rooted in understanding how power operates.","A discussion of racial capitalism must first examine who holds power."]}
{"orig":"Capitalism concentrates power in the hands of those who own and control resources.","cands":["In capitalism, those who control assets hold the power.","Resource ownership equals power within capitalist systems.","Power is centralized among capital holders."]}
{"orig":"In a fair system, economic mobility would allow anyone to rise through effort and innovation.","cands":["Ideally, hard work and creativity would be enough for success.","In a just economy, all people could advance by merit.","Fairness would mean everyone has a path upward through achievement."]}
{"orig":"But history shows that the playing field was uneven long before the game began.","cands":["Reality reveals the competition was rigged from the start.","The starting conditions were never equal, even before capitalism emerged.","Long before now, opportunities were distributed unfairly."]}
{"orig":"Slavery, colonial extraction, segregation, discriminatory policy, and policing did more than limit opportunity — they generated enormous wealth for those at the top while structurally withholding it from those at the bottom.","cands":["Systems like slavery and colonialism enriched elites while trapping others in deprivation.","Exploitation was not just restrictive—it produced wealth upward while blocking it downward.","These institutions funneled profit to the powerful and denied it to the oppressed."]}
{"orig":"One of the most striking examples comes from the history of American law enforcement and incarceration.","cands":["The U.S. policing and prison system offers a clear illustration.","American criminal justice provides a vivid case study.","A powerful example lies in how U.S. prisons and policing developed."]}
{"orig":"After the end of slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment famously prohibited forced labor — except as punishment for a crime.","cands":["Slavery was outlawed—except when someone was convicted of a crime.","The 13th Amendment banned involuntary labor with a crucial exception.","Forced labor continued legally through the criminal punishment clause."]}
{"orig":"That loophole was not an oversight.","cands":["This gap in the law was intentional.","The exception was designed, not accidental.","It was a purposeful opening, not a mistake."]}
{"orig":"It created a direct pathway for slavery to continue in a new form.","cands":["This allowed slavery to transform rather than end.","It enabled bondage to survive under a different name.","The system simply rebranded forced labor instead of abolishing it."]}
{"orig":"Black Americans, newly freed from plantation labor, were arrested on vague charges like vagrancy or “suspicious behavior,” then leased out to corporations and industries that needed cheap labor.","cands":["After emancipation, Black people were criminalized and forced into labor for private profit.","Corporations benefited from the re-enslavement of freed Black citizens through bogus arrests.","Black freedom was undermined by a prison leasing system driven by economic demand."]}
{"orig":"Incarceration became profitable, and Black bodies once again became instruments of economic expansion.","cands":["Prisons turned into business ventures that exploited Black labor.","Profit motives reshaped imprisonment into a new form of exploitation.","Once again, Black people’s bodies fueled economic growth through captivity."]}
{"orig":"The racial hierarchy had not disappeared; it had simply adapted to the legal system of a capitalist democracy.","cands":["Racial domination changed forms to fit capitalist law.","Inequality persisted by reshaping itself to match new rules.","The power structure didn’t vanish—it evolved to survive in democracy."]}
{"orig":"The pattern repeated itself years later under the banner of “law and order.”","cands":["Later, the same logic resurfaced under slogans about security.","The system reasserted itself through “law and order” campaigns.","History echoed as policing again targeted marginalized communities."]}
{"orig":"Harsh drug policies punished heavily in the communities least protected from poverty and systemic neglect.","cands":["Drug laws struck hardest in neglected, impoverished neighborhoods.","The war on drugs disproportionately harmed those already burdened by inequality.","The most vulnerable communities faced the harshest crackdowns."]}
{"orig":"Crack cocaine — associated with Black neighborhoods — carried sentences far more severe than powder cocaine — linked to wealthier, whiter users.","cands":["Crack was punished more harshly than cocaine used by affluent white people.","Drug sentencing reflected racial bias: crack harsher, powder lenient.","The same drug brought harsher penalties when tied to Black communities."]}
{"orig":"The justification, framed as science and public safety, masked an economic logic: prisons filled, private contracts expanded, police departments gained funding, municipalities collected fines.","cands":["Claims of safety hid the financial incentives behind mass incarceration.","Behind scientific rhetoric was a profit engine that expanded carceral systems.","Economic gain—more prisoners, more money—drove policy under a disguise of safety."]}
{"orig":"Inequality was not incidental; it was profitable.","cands":["Exclusion generated income rather than occurring by accident.","Wealth was built directly from unequal treatment.","Profit thrived because of injustice, not despite it."]}
{"orig":"These mechanisms are not confined to the most dramatic examples of imprisonment or legislation.","cands":["This pattern extends far beyond prisons and major laws.","It doesn’t only show up in big, visible systems.","Racial capitalism also operates in ordinary, less noticeable spaces."]}
{"orig":"Sometimes they appear in the small details of daily life.","cands":["They show up quietly in everyday routines.","Daily experiences also carry these injustices.","The subtle moments of life reveal the same logic."]}
{"orig":"In cities like Ferguson, Missouri, minor infractions — jaywalking, a broken tail light, missing paperwork — became opportunities for local governments to extract money from residents, who were disproportionately Black and poor.","cands":["In places such as Ferguson, tiny violations became cash sources taken mostly from poor Black residents.","Local governments used petty offenses to squeeze revenue from vulnerable communities.","Minor legal issues turned into predatory fines targeting Black, low-income populations."]}
{"orig":"A single unpaid ticket could snowball into hundreds of dollars in fees, arrest warrants, and job-threatening legal troubles.","cands":["One small fine could escalate into major financial and legal crises.","Tiny debts ballooned into warrants and lost employment opportunities.","A minor setback became a life-altering punishment through compounding fees."]}
{"orig":"When people cannot pay, they are punished; when they are punished, they are charged even more.","cands":["Inability to pay leads to punishment, and punishment leads to further costs.","Falling behind financially results in deeper financial consequences.","The system penalizes poverty by making people poorer."]}
{"orig":"Poverty becomes a revenue stream.","cands":["The poor become a source of profit.","Scarcity itself is monetized.","Economic extraction feeds on people’s lack of money."]}
{"orig":"Racial capitalism turns the struggle for survival into someone else’s gain.","cands":["One person’s fight to survive becomes another’s profit.","Survival under racial capitalism benefits others more than the struggling.","Hardship itself becomes a source of revenue for those in power."]}
{"orig":"The same logic extends into healthcare, housing, schooling — every domain where resources are distributed unevenly and those with the fewest resources have the highest costs.","cands":["Healthcare, housing, and education operate under the same exploitative rules, where the poorest pay the most.","This pattern shows up anywhere resources are scarce and inequality is present.","Across society’s basic services, those with less end up paying more."]}
{"orig":"In medical settings, whose pain is believed?","cands":["Healthcare raises the question: whose suffering counts?","A key issue in medicine is deciding whose discomfort is taken seriously.","Doctors must confront the unequal credibility given to patients’ pain."]}
{"orig":"Whose symptoms are dismissed?","cands":["Which patients get brushed off?","Who is ignored when they describe their suffering?","Whose health concerns are not taken seriously?"]}
{"orig":"Studies repeatedly show that Black patients receive poorer treatment than white patients, both due to bias and because the financial incentives of the U.S. healthcare system prioritize those who can pay more.","cands":["Research confirms that Black people get worse care because bias combines with profit-driven medicine.","Black patients are treated less seriously due to racism and the system’s preference for wealthier patients.","The healthcare economy rewards treating those who can afford it, worsening outcomes for Black patients."]}
{"orig":"Housing policy historically pushed Black families into underfunded neighborhoods with limited opportunity and higher exposure to environmental hazards, while property values — and therefore wealth accumulation — flourished in white suburbs protected by racist zoning laws.","cands":["Segregated housing trapped Black communities in neglected areas while white suburbs grew rich.","Racist zoning concentrated risk and scarcity in Black neighborhoods and prosperity in white ones.","Discriminatory housing laws deprived Black families of wealth opportunities and environmental safety."]}
{"orig":"Even the most celebrated pillar of equality, education, has a hidden function: sorting students into economic roles that support the existing hierarchy.","cands":["Schooling, despite its promise, often channels students into predefined economic positions.","Education frequently reinforces class and racial structures instead of disrupting them.","The school system helps maintain the hierarchy by assigning people to their future roles."]}
{"orig":"This is where psychology enters the conversation.","cands":["At this point, psychology becomes relevant.","Psychology plays a key role in this dynamic.","Here, psychological science steps into the picture."]}
{"orig":"Psychology should be a science dedicated to understanding and helping humans.","cands":["Ideally, psychology exists to support and explain human well-being.","The field’s purpose ought to be human flourishing.","Psychology’s mission should center on helping people thrive."]}
{"orig":"But for much of its history, it has served the interests of those who held power.","cands":["Yet historically, psychology often aligned with the powerful.","The discipline has frequently reinforced dominance rather than challenged it.","Psychology has long been used to protect authority, not liberation."]}
{"orig":"Scientific racism dressed prejudice in the language of intelligence testing, biology, and mental health.","cands":["Racism hid behind claims of science — IQ tests, anatomical theories, psychiatry.","Pseudoscience justified discrimination through biased measures of “intelligence.”","Prejudice was rebranded as objective truth through racist scientific practices."]}
{"orig":"It claimed that unequal outcomes reflected inherent differences rather than structural oppression.","cands":["The message was that inequality comes from “natural” inferiority—not injustice.","These theories blamed biology instead of systems of oppression.","Science was used to argue that marginalized groups deserved their disadvantage."]}
{"orig":"Psychological “expertise” was used to justify segregation, forced assimilation, and discrimination under the guise of objectivity.","cands":["Psychologists lent credibility to policies of separation and cultural erasure.","The profession validated discriminatory measures as scientifically neutral.","Under the mask of science, psychology excused racist control."]}
{"orig":"Instead of asking how society harms marginalized groups, psychology often asked what was wrong with those groups for struggling within harmful systems.","cands":["The field pathologized victims rather than critiquing oppression.","Psychologists blamed the oppressed instead of the structures crushing them.","It questioned marginalized people’s abilities rather than the inequities they faced."]}
{"orig":"The result was a narrative that blamed the oppressed for the hardships imposed on them.","cands":["This created a story that framed victims as the cause of their own suffering.","The narrative made structural violence look like personal failure.","Oppressors were absolved while the oppressed were accused."]}
{"orig":"Generations of people were told that their suffering was the outcome of personal deficits, not historical violence.","cands":["Communities internalized the lie that their struggles came from within rather than from injustice.","People were taught to view oppression as their own fault.","History’s wounds were reframed as individual weaknesses."]}
{"orig":"The wealthy and powerful remained unquestioned.","cands":["Those in control avoided scrutiny.","Elites stayed protected from blame.","Power structures remained unchallenged and intact."]}
{"orig":"The oppressed were studied as problems rather than partners.","cands":["Marginalized communities were treated as cases instead of collaborators.","They became research subjects, not voices shaping the knowledge.","Psychology positioned the oppressed as issues to be fixed, not equals to be heard."]}
{"orig":"Yet not all scholarship accepted this arrangement.","cands":["But some thinkers challenged this system.","Resistance emerged within the academic world.","Not every scholar went along with the oppressive narrative."]}
{"orig":"Movements like History from Below and Liberation Psychology emerged to confront the ways knowledge can either reinforce or challenge power.","cands":["New approaches arose to reveal how scholarship can support justice instead of dominance.","Liberation-focused movements showed how academia influences power relations.","These schools of thought expose how research can either uphold or dismantle oppression."]}
{"orig":"History from Below shifts focus away from kings, nations, and powerful leaders toward the everyday people whose labor, resistance, and survival actually shape history.","cands":["This method centers ordinary people as the main drivers of historical change.","History from Below emphasizes workers, survivors, and resisters over elites.","It spotlights the masses whose actions truly build societies."]}
{"orig":"It recognizes that the struggles of workers, enslaved people, and marginalized communities are not side notes — they are the foundation on which nations are built.","cands":["These struggles are fundamental, not peripheral, to the making of societies.","The labor and resistance of oppressed groups are core historical forces.","Nations rest on the efforts of those most exploited."]}
{"orig":"When you tell the story from their perspective, the image of progress looks very different.","cands":["Viewing history through their eyes transforms our understanding of “advancement.”","Progress appears radically different when centered on the oppressed.","The narrative shifts dramatically when told from below."]}
{"orig":"The wealth of modern capitalism does not appear as the reward of innovation alone, but as the accumulated profit of extraction and exclusion.","cands":["Capitalist riches reveal themselves as the product of exploitation, not just brilliance.","Prosperity emerges from what has been taken, not only what has been created.","Extraction and inequality, not innovation alone, generated today’s wealth."]}
{"orig":"Liberation Psychology takes a similar turn in a different field.","cands":["In psychology, liberation theory echoes this bottom-up shift.","A parallel movement appears within psychology.","Psychology has its own version of this corrective approach."]}
{"orig":"Instead of treating individuals as isolated minds with internal disorders, it examines how social structures harm mental wellbeing.","cands":["It focuses on how society injures people, not just how people struggle within themselves.","The approach investigates external injustice as the root of suffering.","Liberation psychology emphasizes context over individual pathology."]}
{"orig":"It recognizes that trauma, stress, and psychological suffering often stem from inequality — and that healing involves changing those systems, not forcing individuals to adapt to them.","cands":["It argues that well-being requires transforming oppressive conditions.","Healing means altering the world, not pretending it’s fine.","The goal is systemic change rather than individual adjustment."]}
{"orig":"Where traditional psychology asked how to help marginalized people function within oppressive realities, liberation psychology asks how to dismantle the oppression itself.","cands":["Instead of adapting people to injustice, it targets the injustice.","The focus shifts from coping to liberation.","It seeks to change systems rather than change victims."]}
{"orig":"These approaches flip the script.","cands":["They reverse the usual viewpoint.","The narrative is completely turned around.","They restructure how we interpret social problems."]}
{"orig":"They say that the perspective of the oppressed is not an alternative version of the story; it is the truth that the dominant narrative worked to bury.","cands":["The marginalized perspective becomes the primary truth, not a side note.","These approaches assert that oppressed people hold the real story.","They reveal truths that power tried to hide beneath its own telling."]}
{"orig":"Understanding racial capitalism is not only about history.","cands":["Racial capitalism isn’t just a historical topic.","It’s not merely a matter of the past.","Grasping racial capitalism requires more than looking backward."]}
{"orig":"It’s about recognizing how current systems continue to operate on the same principles.","cands":["It also demands noticing how today’s systems repeat those logics.","We must see that the same dynamics still shape society now.","It means acknowledging that modern structures run on the same rules."]}
{"orig":"Today, corporations profit from underpaid labor in gig economies where workers lack rights and stability.","cands":["Current gig markets exploit cheap, unstable labor for corporate gain.","Companies benefit from precarious workers in today’s gig economy.","Low-wage gig work creates profit while denying workers protections."]}
{"orig":"Neighborhoods historically segregated still display predictable disparities in wealth and opportunity.","cands":["Places once separated by race remain unequal in income and mobility.","Segregation’s legacy still shapes who has access to resources.","The economic map still mirrors the old color lines."]}
{"orig":"Political campaigns rely on racial fear to win votes that protect elite financial interests.","cands":["Politicians weaponize racial anxiety to secure power for the wealthy.","Racialized messaging is used to uphold elite economic control.","Campaigns use race-based fear to maintain systems that favor the rich."]}
{"orig":"Mental health disorders rise in communities living under constant stress, and the burden is placed on individuals to cope while the structural causes remain intact.","cands":["Stress-filled environments fuel psychological harm, yet individuals are blamed instead of systems.","Communities endure mental strain while the system avoids accountability.","People are told to manage anxiety even as injustice keeps producing it."]}
{"orig":"We also need to understand that racism adapts.","cands":["Racism evolves rather than disappears.","Discrimination shifts forms over time.","Racism changes shape to survive."]}
{"orig":"It rarely announces itself openly.","cands":["It often hides in subtlety.","Racism is usually quiet rather than blatant.","It tends to operate under the radar."]}
{"orig":"It appears through economic policies, scientific claims, and cultural norms that feel “neutral” but produce racially unequal outcomes.","cands":["Racism hides behind neutral-seeming laws, science, and customs that create inequity.","Policies and norms present as objective often yield racial disparities.","It disguises itself in supposedly impartial decisions that harm marginalized groups."]}
{"orig":"That is what makes racial capitalism so persistent.","cands":["This camouflage is why racial capitalism endures.","Its subtlety gives it staying power.","It persists because it’s built into systems, not just attitudes."]}
{"orig":"It hides its exploitation behind the appearance of fairness.","cands":["Exploitation is masked by claims of equality.","It pretends to be fair while producing injustice.","A façade of neutrality conceals oppression."]}
{"orig":"It convinces society that success is simply a matter of effort, even when the ground is tilted so steeply that climbing is nearly impossible for some and effortless for others.","cands":["It promotes the myth of merit despite wildly unequal starting points.","People are told to just work harder while the path is uneven.","It sells the idea of fair competition while the race is rigged."]}
{"orig":"The challenge ahead is not simply documenting inequality — we have centuries of documentation already.","cands":["The task now isn’t to collect more evidence — we’ve done that.","Proving inequality isn’t the issue; it’s long been proven.","We don’t need more records of injustice to know it exists."]}
{"orig":"The challenge is deciding what to do with that knowledge.","cands":["What matters is how we act on what we know.","The question becomes how we use this information for change.","Applying that understanding is the real test."]}
{"orig":"Psychology has an opportunity here to shift fully away from its past role as a tool of justification and toward a future focused on empowerment.","cands":["Psychology can leave behind its history of defending power and support liberation instead.","The field has a chance to become a force for empowerment rather than control.","Psychological science could transform into a tool of justice going forward."]}
{"orig":"Researchers are now studying how inequality affects cognitive development, mental health, stress responses, and identity.","cands":["Scientists investigate how inequity impacts brains, emotions, and sense of self.","Experts are mapping the effects of oppression on psychological functioning.","Current research examines how social inequality shapes mental well-being."]}
{"orig":"They are identifying the pathways by which oppressive conditions produce harm.","cands":["They trace how unjust systems cause psychological damage.","Researchers are uncovering the mechanisms linking oppression to suffering.","We are learning exactly how inequality translates into harm."]}
{"orig":"This knowledge can become a tool for change if we let it.","cands":["Such understanding could drive meaningful reform.","These insights can empower transformation.","If applied wisely, this evidence could reshape society."]}
{"orig":"There are signs of progress.","cands":["Some changes are already visible.","Momentum for improvement is emerging.","We can see progress beginning to take form."]}
{"orig":"Community-based mental health programs challenge the idea that help must come from experts outside the community.","cands":["Local mental health efforts reject the notion that outsiders always know best.","These programs show healing can be rooted within communities.","Support led by community members counters top-down assistance models."]}
{"orig":"Social psychology experiments reveal how stereotypes are learned, how biases form, and how systems can be redesigned to reduce their impact.","cands":["Studies show how prejudice develops and how structures can be changed to prevent it.","Research uncovers the creation of bias and strategies to dismantle it.","We’re learning how stereotypes take hold and how systems can interrupt them."]}
{"orig":"Liberation psychology emphasizes collective action over individual coping, helping people recognize that their struggles are not evidence of personal failure but symptoms of unjust systems.","cands":["Instead of isolating people, it empowers group resistance to structural harm.","It teaches that suffering comes from inequality, not individual deficiency.","Collective solutions replace self-blame as the path to healing."]}
{"orig":"History from Below encourages students — the future leaders and voters and policymakers — to see that the world they accept today was created by human decisions, and human decisions can change it.","cands":["This approach shows new generations that society is built by choices, and choices can be remade.","It teaches emerging leaders that today’s world is not inevitable and can be transformed.","Students learn that what exists now was constructed — and can be reconstructed."]}
{"orig":"Still, awareness is only the first step.","cands":["Knowing is not the same as acting.","Recognition alone isn’t enough.","Understanding must be followed by action."]}
{"orig":"Racial capitalism is deeply rooted, fueled by laws, profit structures, media narratives, and even the subconscious assumptions we inherit from the world around us.","cands":["It is embedded in systems, stories, and unconscious beliefs.","Racial capitalism persists through legislation, profit, culture, and implicit bias.","Its strength lies in structural and psychological entanglements."]}
{"orig":"There is no single policy that will undo its effects, no brief period of reform that will erase centuries of exploitation.","cands":["No quick fix can reverse such long-standing oppression.","One law won’t dismantle a centuries-old structure.","The damage runs too deep for simple or short reforms."]}
{"orig":"But shifting the lens — choosing to center the voices and experiences of those harmed by these systems — is a necessary beginning.","cands":["A crucial first step is focusing on the marginalized perspective.","Progress starts by listening to those who have been oppressed.","Change begins by centering the lived realities of the harmed."]}
{"orig":"If society continues to learn history only from the perspective of conquerors and capitalism only from the perspective of beneficiaries, the injustice will stay invisible.","cands":["As long as we view the world only through the victor’s eyes, oppression remains hidden.","Listening only to the winners keeps inequality out of sight.","Stories told by the powerful alone ensure injustice stays disguised."]}
{"orig":"The question, ultimately, is what kind of world we want to build.","cands":["What future do we choose to shape?","In the end, we must decide what kind of society we aim for.","The real issue is imagining the world we’re trying to create."]}
{"orig":"A system that requires some people to remain vulnerable for others to feel secure is not sustainable.","cands":["We cannot uphold a structure where one group’s safety depends on another’s harm.","A society built on the vulnerability of some will inevitably collapse.","Security for the few at the expense of many is doomed to fail."]}
{"orig":"A form of prosperity that depends on the suffering of others cannot be considered progress.","cands":["Wealth built on someone else’s pain isn’t progress at all.","Success that exploits others is not real advancement.","Prosperity that demands harm is a false kind of progress."]}
{"orig":"If we believe that human beings deserve dignity, opportunity, and autonomy, then we need an economic system that reflects those values.","cands":["If dignity and freedom truly matter, our economy must embody them.","Believing in equal worth requires redesigning how the economy works.","Values like dignity and opportunity must be built into our economic structure."]}
{"orig":"That requires re-examining the foundations rather than patching up the visible cracks.","cands":["We must rebuild from the ground up, not just make surface fixes.","True reform means changing basics, not just appearances.","Solving this demands root-level change, not cosmetic repair."]}
{"orig":"Racial capitalism teaches us that inequality is not an accident — it is a design.","cands":["Racial capitalism shows inequality is intentional, not accidental.","It reveals that the system was constructed to be unequal.","Inequality is baked into racial capitalism by design."]}
{"orig":"Liberation psychology and History from Below teach us that designs can be changed if the people they harm gain the ability to redefine the narrative.","cands":["These approaches remind us that systems can be rebuilt when the oppressed reclaim the story.","They show that narratives change when marginalized voices lead.","Redesign becomes possible when those harmed control the narrative."]}
{"orig":"Psychology’s role must be to support that process, not obstruct it.","cands":["Psychology should aid liberation, not stand in its way.","The field must serve change rather than hinder it.","Psychology must help, not block, social transformation."]}
{"orig":"History’s purpose must be to uncover the truth rather than protect the comfortable.","cands":["History should expose reality, not shield those in power.","The discipline must reveal hidden truths, not uphold comfort.","Telling history should disrupt convenience, not preserve privilege."]}
{"orig":"There is still a long way to go.","cands":["Much progress remains ahead.","The journey is far from over.","We have significant work left to do."]}
{"orig":"But naming the connection between capitalism and racial exploitation gives us the language needed to challenge it.","cands":["Recognizing this link gives us the vocabulary to fight back.","Labeling the system openly is the first tool of resistance.","Understanding the connection arms us with critical language."]}
{"orig":"Listening to the stories of those who lived that exploitation gives us the motive to stop it.","cands":["Hearing the oppressed inspires action to end injustice.","Their lived experiences motivate change.","The narratives of the harmed compel us to intervene."]}
{"orig":"And recognizing that systems are human creations gives us the responsibility to build something better.","cands":["If humans built these systems, humans must fix them.","Knowing structures are man-made means we must reshape them.","Their human origins oblige us to reimagine them."]}
{"orig":"If racial capitalism created the world we inherited, then our task now is to ensure it does not define the world we leave behind.","cands":["If exploitation shaped our present, we must make sure it doesn’t shape our future.","The legacy of racial capitalism should stop with us, not continue onward.","What we inherited must not be what we pass down."]}
