Capitalism relies on inequity as fuel, not as an accident or mistake. Wealth has repeatedly been built by extracting labor and value from racially targeted peoples. Race functioned as a sorting system to assign economic roles and worth. These structures have shaped society for generations and still influence life today in invisible ways. A deeper look at history reveals capitalism rose by turning racial groups into economic resources. And the institutions that claim to study human behavior and society — history, science, psychology — have often worked to reinforce rather than challenge these structures. Power is the starting point for analyzing racial capitalism. Resource ownership equals power within capitalist systems. Ideally, hard work and creativity would be enough for success. The starting conditions were never equal, even before capitalism emerged. Slavery, colonial extraction, segregation, discriminatory policy, and policing did more than limit opportunity — they generated enormous wealth for those at the top while structurally withholding it from those at the bottom. A powerful example lies in how U.S. prisons and policing developed. The 13th Amendment banned involuntary labor with a crucial exception. The exception was designed, not accidental. The system simply rebranded forced labor instead of abolishing it. After emancipation, Black people were criminalized and forced into labor for private profit. Once again, Black people’s bodies fueled economic growth through captivity. Inequality persisted by reshaping itself to match new rules. The pattern repeated itself years later under the banner of “law and order.” Harsh drug policies punished heavily in the communities least protected from poverty and systemic neglect. The same drug brought harsher penalties when tied to Black communities. Economic gain—more prisoners, more money—drove policy under a disguise of safety. Wealth was built directly from unequal treatment. It doesn’t only show up in big, visible systems. Sometimes they appear in the small details of daily life. Minor legal issues turned into predatory fines targeting Black, low-income populations. Tiny debts ballooned into warrants and lost employment opportunities. Falling behind financially results in deeper financial consequences. Scarcity itself is monetized. One person’s fight to survive becomes another’s profit. Across society’s basic services, those with less end up paying more. Doctors must confront the unequal credibility given to patients’ pain. Whose symptoms are dismissed? The healthcare economy rewards treating those who can afford it, worsening outcomes for Black patients. Discriminatory housing laws deprived Black families of wealth opportunities and environmental safety. Schooling, despite its promise, often channels students into predefined economic positions. Psychology plays a key role in this dynamic. The field’s purpose ought to be human flourishing. But for much of its history, it has served the interests of those who held power. Racism hid behind claims of science — IQ tests, anatomical theories, psychiatry. The message was that inequality comes from “natural” inferiority—not injustice. Psychological “expertise” was used to justify segregation, forced assimilation, and discrimination under the guise of objectivity. Instead of asking how society harms marginalized groups, psychology often asked what was wrong with those groups for struggling within harmful systems. The narrative made structural violence look like personal failure. History’s wounds were reframed as individual weaknesses. Power structures remained unchallenged and intact. The oppressed were studied as problems rather than partners. Yet not all scholarship accepted this arrangement. Movements like History from Below and Liberation Psychology emerged to confront the ways knowledge can either reinforce or challenge power. History from Below emphasizes workers, survivors, and resisters over elites. The labor and resistance of oppressed groups are core historical forces. Progress appears radically different when centered on the oppressed. Extraction and inequality, not innovation alone, generated today’s wealth. Psychology has its own version of this corrective approach. Liberation psychology emphasizes context over individual pathology. It argues that well-being requires transforming oppressive conditions. It seeks to change systems rather than change victims. They reverse the usual viewpoint. The marginalized perspective becomes the primary truth, not a side note. Racial capitalism isn’t just a historical topic. It also demands noticing how today’s systems repeat those logics. Companies benefit from precarious workers in today’s gig economy. The economic map still mirrors the old color lines. Racialized messaging is used to uphold elite economic control. Mental health disorders rise in communities living under constant stress, and the burden is placed on individuals to cope while the structural causes remain intact. Discrimination shifts forms over time. Racism is usually quiet rather than blatant. Policies and norms present as objective often yield racial disparities. It persists because it’s built into systems, not just attitudes. It pretends to be fair while producing injustice. People are told to just work harder while the path is uneven. The task now isn’t to collect more evidence — we’ve done that. Applying that understanding is the real test. Psychology can leave behind its history of defending power and support liberation instead. Experts are mapping the effects of oppression on psychological functioning. They are identifying the pathways by which oppressive conditions produce harm. If applied wisely, this evidence could reshape society. We can see progress beginning to take form. Community-based mental health programs challenge the idea that help must come from experts outside the community. Social psychology experiments reveal how stereotypes are learned, how biases form, and how systems can be redesigned to reduce their impact. It teaches that suffering comes from inequality, not individual deficiency. It teaches emerging leaders that today’s world is not inevitable and can be transformed. Recognition alone isn’t enough. Its strength lies in structural and psychological entanglements. One law won’t dismantle a centuries-old structure. Progress starts by listening to those who have been oppressed. As long as we view the world only through the victor’s eyes, oppression remains hidden. The real issue is imagining the world we’re trying to create. Security for the few at the expense of many is doomed to fail. Wealth built on someone else’s pain isn’t progress at all. If dignity and freedom truly matter, our economy must embody them. That requires re-examining the foundations rather than patching up the visible cracks. It reveals that the system was constructed to be unequal. Redesign becomes possible when those harmed control the narrative. Psychology should aid liberation, not stand in its way. Telling history should disrupt convenience, not preserve privilege. The journey is far from over. Labeling the system openly is the first tool of resistance. Hearing the oppressed inspires action to end injustice. And recognizing that systems are human creations gives us the responsibility to build something better. What we inherited must not be what we pass down.
